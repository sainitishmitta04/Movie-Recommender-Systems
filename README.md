Content-Based Movie Recommender System using Cosine Similarity
This project aims to use a content-based filtering approach to recommend movies to users, specifically leveraging cosine similarity as the measure of similarity between movies. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

## Content-Based Filtering:

Recommends movies based on the content features of movies the user has liked before.
These features can include:
Genre: Drama, comedy, action, etc.

Director and actors: Movies by the same director or starring the same actors.

Keywords: Extracted from plot summaries, reviews, or other textual descriptions.

Themes: Sentiment analysis on descriptions for tags like "coming-of-age" or "supernatural."
## Cosine Similarity:

A mathematical measure to quantify the similarity between two vectors.
In this context, each movie is represented as a vector where each element corresponds to a content feature and its value reflects its importance in that movie.
The higher the cosine similarity between two movies, the more similar they are in terms of content.
Project Implementation:

## Usually involves these steps:
**Data Collection:** Gather movie data with relevant features. Popular sources include TMDB API or movie websites.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform data into a suitable format for analysis. This might involve text cleaning, stemming/lemmatization, and feature engineering.

**Feature Vectorization:** Convert textual features (e.g., genres, keywords) into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or word embedding.

**Cosine Similarity Calculation:** Compute cosine similarity between all movie pairs to create a similarity matrix.

**Recommendation Generation:** For a given user, find the movies with the highest cosine similarity to movies they liked before, and recommend those.
## Benefits:

Useful when no user preference data is available (e.g., new users).

Can discover hidden gems or niche movies similar to user preferences.

## Challenges:

Relies heavily on the quality and relevance of content features.

May not capture complex user preferences or dynamic tastes.
